First somewhat working version of library.

Now available:
  -An array for storing all books in catalog (booksCatalog);
  -Some functions to operate the catalog:
    
    -showCatalog() - displays all existing books in catalog;
    -addBook(bookName, bookGenre) - Creates new object in bookCatalog array with given name and genre of a new book;
    -sortByName() - sorts all books in catalog by name (a-z);
    -sortByNameReverse() - sorts all books in catalog by name (z-a);
    
    Note: all functions are invoked only trough dev console in browser (for now).
